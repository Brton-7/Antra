//Assignment 2 Arrays and Strings

//Test your knowledge===================================================================

//1. You would use String when concatenating a few strings together, StringBuilder would
//   be better to improve performance and make repeated changes to a string

//2. The Array class

//3. To sort array in ascending order use method Array.Sort(SomeArray), to sort in descending
//   use Array.Reverse(SomeArray) after using the sort method

//4. Use array.Count(); 

//5. You cannot store mutiple data types in System.Array

//6. System.Array.CopyTo() is used to copy elements from an array to a destination (an existing 
//   Array). System.Array.Clone() makes an exact copy of the array including its length.
