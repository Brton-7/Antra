//Assignment 03 Object-Oriented Programming
//1. a-Public: public access members/modifiers that can be used anywhere in a project
//   b-Private: private access membeer that can only be accessed in current class
//   c-Protected: protected access member can be accessed within current class and derived classes
//   d-Internal: member that can be accessed by classes within current project assembly
//   e-Protected Internal: members that can only be accessed by classes within projects or child classes in other projects
//   f-Private Protected: Members that can be accessed by current class or child class within a project assembly only

//2. The static keyword declares a stic member that applies to its type, the const keyword declares a constant that cannot
//   be modified. The read only keyword defines an unchanging field that can be assigned at compile time or runtime(in constructor).

//3. A constructor is used to create objects for a class and assigns values to its members

//4. Partial keyword is useful when implemeting the functionality of a single class across multiple files

//5. A tupple is a data structure that can store elements of multiple data types

//6. A tuple is a reference type that can be used in place of classes and structs

//7. Overloading is having multiple methods with the same name but with different parameters and implementations.
//   Overidding is redefining the implementation of a method in an inherited class.

//8. A field is a variable of certain type declared in a class and a property is a member of a class that requires other class members 
//   to read, write or access this 

//9. A method parameter can be made optional by either adding a default value or overloading the method.

//10. The difference between interface and abstract is that abstract is used as a base of a class and cannot be instantiated but accessed.
//    An interface is different in that its members must be instantiated by the class that is using it.

//11. Members of an interface can have the same access modifiers as regular classes
